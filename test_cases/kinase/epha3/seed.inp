#           Modification of February 2002:
#           List of points (e.g. ligand heavy atoms of a known ligand-receptor 
#           complex structure) in the binding site used to select polar and apolar 
#           rec. vectors which satisfy the angle criterion (see parameters file)
#           First line:  number of points (0: no removal of vectors using the angle criterion)
#           Following lines:  coordinates of the points to define the binding site. (Here from 4gk2 ligand).
